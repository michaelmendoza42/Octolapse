### Slicer Type
Octolapse will be easier to configure if you select the slicer you are using.  You have the following options:

* Automatic Configuration
* Cura V4.1 and Below
* Cura V4.2 and Above
* Slic3r Prusa Edition
* Simplify 3D
* Other Slicer (generic slicer)

#### Automatic Configuration
Octolapse will attempt to automatically extract your slicer settings.  Currently Cura, Slic3r PE, Prusa Slicer, and Simplify 3D are supported.  [See this guilde](https://github.com/FormerLurker/Octolapse/wiki/Automatic-Slicer-Settings) for information on how to enable automatic slicer configuration.

**Important Notes**:  Cura requires a script to be added to the start gcode for **Automatic Configuration** to work.  Additionally, automatic settings extraction will NOT work when using multi-material/extruder mode in Slic3r/Slic3rPE/PrusaSlicer.  Finally, Multi-Material/Multi-Extruder support is beta, and should be used with caution. 

#### Cura Settings - Manual
Cura settings have changed slightly between version 4.1 and 4.2, so be sure to choose the correct version here.  This will happen automatically if you are using 'Automatic Configuration' and have correctly configured Cura.
